Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "PTB2"      (component BitIO)
   - PTB2_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - PTB2_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or 
                a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - PTB2_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - PTB2_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "PTB3"      (component BitIO)
   - PTB3_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - PTB3_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or 
                a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - PTB3_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - PTB3_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "PTC2"      (component BitIO)
   - PTC2_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - PTC2_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or 
                a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - PTC2_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - PTC2_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "AS1"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK22FN512DC12)
